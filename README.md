# Netflix: A Data Analysis

Netflix is the world’s most leading streaming platform that offers a wide variety of award-winning movies, TV-shows and documentaries across a wide range of genres and languages. Netflix has had an incredible growth over the last decade in terms of the number of subscribers and revenue generated and is said to be worth $125 billion having more than 150 million subscribers from all around the world.
But the real question is, given all these impressive figures, what is actually on Netflix? Like most people, I Spend More Time Deciding What to Watch Than Actually Watching. Due to the vast amount of information available on the web and poor decision-making skills, ‘decision paralysis’ is real, and tugs even harder while trying to pull up a movie to watch on Netflix.

## Project's Aim:
The aim is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset that would enable me to pick something to watch based on preferred recommendations without having to spend too much time.
To achieve this goal, I have uncovered the following insights:
1.	What kind of content is more popular on Netflix? Does Netflix have more Movies or TV Shows?
2.	Which country produces the most content?
3.	Amount of content as a function of time. How ‘old’ is the content on Netflix?
4.	Identifying top listed Genres and their content. Are there more thrillers or action-related content, stand-up comedies or dramas?
5.	Analyzing the most popular content by their rating. Is there more mature or kids-friendly content?
6.	Top Directors and Top Actors and their corresponding movie/TV shows. Which actors do we see more often on Netflix?

I have also created a content-based recommender system that recommends 10 movies/TV shows by taking a movie title as input and recommending similar movies as output back to the user.
